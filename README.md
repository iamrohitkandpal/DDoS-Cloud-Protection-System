## 🏗️ Architecture
![System Architecture](docs/images/architecture-diagram.png)

The DDoS Protection System employs a multi-layered architecture:

1. **Traffic Ingestion Layer**: Captures and filters incoming requests
2. **Analysis Engine**: Processes traffic data using both rule-based and ML algorithms
3. **Cache Layer**: Redis-powered rate limiting and blacklist management
4. **Persistent Storage**: MongoDB for long-term attack pattern storage and analytics
5. **Administration Dashboard**: React-based interface for monitoring and configuration

> For a detailed architecture explanation, see [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md)

## 🚀 Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamrohitkandpal/ddos-protection-system.git
cd ddos-protection-system

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
   ```

2. Configure environment variables:
   ```
   # Backend .env
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ddos-protection
   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
   LOG_LEVEL=info
   
   # Frontend .env
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   ```

3. Start development servers:
   ```bash
   # Start backend server
   cd backend
   npm run dev

## Security Considerations

- This project uses environment variables for all sensitive credentials
- NEVER commit your `.env` file to version control
- Use different credentials for development and production environments
- Set up proper access controls for your MongoDB and Redis instances

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you'll need to set up the following environment variables in a `.env` file:
