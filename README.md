## 🏗️ Architecture
![System Architecture](docs/images/architecture-diagram.png)

The DDoS Protection System employs a multi-layered architecture:

1. **Traffic Ingestion Layer**: Captures and filters incoming requests
2. **Analysis Engine**: Processes traffic data using both rule-based and ML algorithms
3. **Cache Layer**: Redis-powered rate limiting and blacklist management
4. **Persistent Storage**: MongoDB for long-term attack pattern storage and analytics
5. **Administration Dashboard**: React-based interface for monitoring and configuration

> For a detailed architecture explanation, see [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md)
