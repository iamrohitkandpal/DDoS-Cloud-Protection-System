# ðŸŒŸ Introduction to DDoS Protection System

## Background
The Digital India initiative has led to a significant increase in government online services, making them potential targets for cyber attacks. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are particularly challenging as they can render critical services unavailable to citizens.

## Project Mission
This project aims to create a specialized protection system that can:
- Identify and mitigate DDoS attacks in real-time
- Provide analytics and insights on traffic patterns
- Minimize false positives to ensure legitimate users maintain access
- Scale to protect multiple government websites simultaneously

## Target Applications
The system is designed to protect:
- Government service portals (e.g., Digital Seva)
- Information websites (e.g., India.gov.in)
- Critical infrastructure dashboards
- State government online services

## Unique Challenges
Indian government websites face specific challenges:
- High traffic volumes during peak periods (tax filing seasons, exam results)
- Diverse user base across varied internet infrastructure
- Geopolitical targeting considerations
- Need for compliance with Indian IT Act and other regulations

## System Overview
Our solution leverages modern web technologies and cloud infrastructure to create a robust protection system that can be easily deployed and managed by government IT departments.
